# Sub-Projects

Helm has various sub-projects being run by different teams of maintainers. This document lists out the sub-projects, were you can find their maintainers, and how to contact them directly.

Joining one of these groups is documented in the [governance](governance/governance.md) and with the respective projects within Helm.

The Org Maintainers are defined in the [governance](governance/governance.md) but are not a sub-project. They define and oversee the sub-projects. This is the high level set of maintainers responsible with the well being of Helm. Consider this a similar team to the Kubernetes Steering Committee.

Repositories under the Helm organization not owned by a sub-project, listed below, are owned by the Org Maintainers.

The Org Maintainers can be directly contacted at the private address of cncf-helm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io. The members of this group are documented in the MAINTAINERS.md file in this repository.
