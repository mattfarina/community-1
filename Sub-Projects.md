# Sub-Projects

Helm has various sub-projects being run by different teams of maintainers. This document lists out the sub-projects, were you can find their maintainers, and how to contact them directly.

Joining one of these groups is documented in the [governance](governance/governance.md) and with the respective projects within Helm.

The Org Maintainers are defined in the [governance](governance/governance.md) but are not a sub-project. They define and oversee the sub-projects. This is the high level set of maintainers responsible with the well being of Helm. Consider this a similar team to the Kubernetes Steering Committee.

Repositories under the Helm organization not owned by a sub-project, listed below, are owned by the Org Maintainers.

The Org Maintainers can be directly contacted at the private address of cncf-helm-maintainers@lists.cncf.io. The members of this group are documented in the MAINTAINERS.md file in this repository.

## Security Team

Helm has a security team and process for handling all security issues. This team, the security process, and the method to contact them (including with the use of encryption) is documented in the SECURITY.md file.

The security team is made up of Helm sub-project maintainers. The Helm Org Maintainers have delegated resolution and disclosure of security issues to this sub-project.

## Helm Client

The [Helm client/CLI](https://github.com/helm/helm) has a dedicated group maintaining it. The members of that team are documented in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/OWNERS) file in the root of the project.

This team can be directly contacted at the private address of cncf-helm-core-maintainers@lists.cncf.io.
